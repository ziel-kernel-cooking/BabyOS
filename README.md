# BabyOS, A fully functional operating system
This OS is dedicated to Terrence Andrew Davis, one of the smartests programmers in the world<br>
<br>
Why I'm making this operating system it's so dump idea to make ring 0 OS, it will not have any practical use etc.:<br>
-I'm making this OS not to create a second Linux or Windows etc. but to learn more about computers and be smarter<br>
<br>
Why you are dedicating this OS to a strange/crazy guy:<br>
-Because:<br>
A: His work inspired me to learn more about computers<br>
B: He was a genius that almost no one appreciated<br>
<br>
Why Baby:<br>
-Because I feel like a baby who wants to understand the whole world<br>
<br>
PS:<br>
I'm new to github, so if I screw something up, please explain it in a polite way, and don't insult or swear.<br>
<br>
To build it install i386-gcc cross compiler(Caution cross compiler installer script is not mine. I added it because if orginal repo will die, you can still easly install this. Orginal repo: https://github.com/mell-o-tron/MellOs/blob/main/A_Setup/setup-gcc-debian.sh)<br>
<code>./setup-gcc-debian.sh</code><br>
And run make.sh<br>
<code>./make.sh</code><br>
