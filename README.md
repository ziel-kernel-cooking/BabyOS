# BabyOS, A fully functional operating system
This OS is dedicated to Terrence Andrew Davis, one of the smartests programmers in the world<br>
To build it install i386-gcc cross compiler(Caution cross compiler installer script is not mine. I added it because if orginal repo will die, you can still easly install this. Orginal repo: https://github.com/mell-o-tron/MellOs/blob/main/A_Setup/setup-gcc-debian.sh)<br>
<code>./setup-gcc-debian.sh</code><br>
And run make.sh<br>
<code>./make.sh</code><br>
